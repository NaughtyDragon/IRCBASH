IRCBASH

A simple BASH script which connects to an IRC server and executes CLI commands on the client machine. No additional IRC Client software is needed. If the machine is able to run Bash it is able to run this script.

This is an example of the usage of Bash socks.

If you bother I wrote the code completely in a bathtub ;)
